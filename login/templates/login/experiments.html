              This experiment is used to estimate the total lipid (fat/oil)
              content in a given sample using the Soxhlet extraction method. The
              process involves dissolving lipids in organic non-polar solvents
              like petroleum spirit, benzene, or hexane, followed by continuous
              heating and cooling for efficient extraction. The extracted crude
              fat/oil is then weighed to determine its percentage in the sample.
              This method is widely used in food, agriculture, and
              pharmaceutical industries to analyze the fat content in various
              biological materials.

              This experiment measures the activity of two enzymes: amylase and
              invertase. Amylase breaks down starch into glucose and maltose,
              while invertase breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose. The
              enzyme activity is determined by measuring the color change caused
              by the reaction products using a spectrophotometer. This helps
              understand how these enzymes work in breaking down sugars.

              This experiment estimates the amount of glucose in a solution by
              using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method. Glucose, being a
              reducing sugar, reacts with DNS, reducing it and forming a
              red-colored product. This red color is measured at 570 nm using a
              spectrophotometer. The intensity of the color is directly
              proportional to the glucose concentration. A standard curve is
              plotted by using known glucose concentrations to calculate the
              glucose content in the unknown sample.

              This experiment estimates the protein content in a sample using
              the Lowry’s method. The protein reacts with alkaline copper
              sulfate to form a complex, and then the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent
              is added, which reacts with the amino acids tyrosine and
              tryptophan in the protein, producing a blue color. The intensity
              of this blue color is proportional to the amount of protein in the
              sample, and it is measured at 660 nm. By comparing the sample's
              optical density with a standard curve, the protein concentration
              in the sample can be determined.

            <p>
              This experiment measures the amount of reducing and non-reducing
              sugars in a food sample.<br />
              1. **Reducing Sugars**: The reducing sugars react with Fehling's
              solution, causing a color change. The amount of Fehling's solution
              used is measured to calculate the reducing sugars in the
              sample.<br />
              2. **Non-reducing Sugars**: Non-reducing sugars (like sucrose) are
              first converted into reducing sugars by adding acid. Then, the
              total reducing sugars are measured using the same Fehling’s
              solution. The difference between total reducing sugars and
              reducing sugars gives the sucrose content.<br />
              In short, this experiment calculates the percentage of reducing
              sugars, total sugars, and sucrose in the sample.

              then the amino acids react with Ninhydrin to form a purple color.
              The intensity of this color is measured at 570 nm using a
              colorimeter. A standard curve is prepared using known
              concentrations of leucine, and the free amino acid concentration
              in the unknown sample is determined by comparing its color
              intensity to the standard. The result is expressed as the

              This experiment demonstrates the preparation, dilution, and

              with accurately preparing a standard NaOH solution by dissolving a
              known weight of solid NaOH in water and transferring it to a
              volumetric flask. The solution is then diluted to a lower
              concentration. To standardize the NaOH solution, it is titrated
              with a standardized hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution, using thymol
              blue as an indicator to identify the endpoint of the reaction. The
              molarity of the NaOH solution is calculated through titration and
              dilution calculations.

              This experiment is designed to quantify the amount of Vitamin C
              (ascorbic acid) in a biological sample, such as citrus fruit
              juice. The principle involves the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol
              indophenol (DCIP) dye by Vitamin C, turning the dye from blue to
              colorless. The endpoint of the titration is marked by the
              appearance of a pale pink color. A standard Vitamin C solution is
              prepared and titrated with the DCIP dye, and the volume of dye
              consumed is used to calculate the concentration of Vitamin C in
              the test sample. The result provides the amount of Vitamin C
              present in 100 grams of the fruit.

            <p>
              This experiment demonstrates the separation of plant pigments
              using column chromatography, a technique based on the differential
              adsorption of compounds onto a solid stationary phase (silica gel)
              and their selective elution using a mobile phase (a mixture of
              petroleum ether and acetone). The plant pigments are first
              extracted from fresh leaves and introduced into the chromatography
              column, where they interact with the silica gel. As the mobile
              phase flows through the column, different pigments move at varying
              rates due to their differing affinities for the stationary phase,
              leading to their separation into distinct colored bands. The
              separated pigments are then collected in different fractions,
              allowing for their individual analysis.
